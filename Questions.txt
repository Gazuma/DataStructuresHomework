HOMEWORK : Nahi karoge to class se bahar
1.Count number of nodes in a linked list✅
2.Sum all the data in linked list and return✅
3.Count the number of even numbers in linked list✅
4.Count the number of odd numbers in linked list✅
5. Count the number of prime numbers in linked list✅
6. Linked List is palindrome or not.✅
    Hint :
  ->store data in stack
  ->keep popping element and compare with LL nodes
  ->if all nodes match with stack return 1 else return 0
7. Write a function to count how many elements are palindrome✅
8. Write program using linked list to find factorial of a large number✅
  Working : 
  0 = 1
  1 = 1
  2 = 1*2
  3 = 1*2*3
  4 = 1*2*3*4
  4! =24 one node has 24%10 = 4 and other node has 24/10, 2%10 = 2
  4->2
  5! = 120
  4->2
  5 Factorial
  5x4 = 20 carry = 2 node value = 0
  5x2 = 10+2(carry)=12%10 = 2 node value = 2
  new node made = 1
  6 Factorial
  6x0 = 0 node value = 0
  6x2 = 12, 12%2 = 2 node value = 2
  carry = 1
  6x1 = 6 + 1(carry)= 7, node value = 7
  
9. Write a program to create bitwise &, without using bitwise & operator and use linked list✅
result also required binary (8 bit prolly)

create binary linked list of both numbers if both 1 put 1 if both 0 put 0

convert to binary

use stack to reverse linked list
